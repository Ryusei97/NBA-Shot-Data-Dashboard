# NBA Dashboard
Streamlit dashboard to visualize [NBA shot location data](https://nba-shot-data-dashboard.streamlit.app/).
This project was inspired by [Matt Parker's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh5c3duQQ1w&t=202s&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths) on the same subject and the goal was to recreate some of the visualizations in an interactive way. The dataset used is available [here](https://data.world/sportsvizsunday/june-2020-nba-shots-1997-2019). The current app can only display pre-computed visualizations but the app can also be run locally by running `streamlit run app.py`. This version also contains a filter for teams as well as the season. The dataset needs to be downloaded into the data folder and then run `processing.py` to prepare the data for the app.
